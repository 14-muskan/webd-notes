    <h1>CSS NOTES - styled using ELEMENT selector</h1>
    <div>
      Ways to add CSS in HTML
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Inline CSS</b> - using style as an attribute for an HTML tag, not
          considered as a good practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Internal CSS</b> - using style as tag nested under head tag, useful
          for small webpages
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>External CSS</b> - using a .css file and linking it with .html,
          considered as most important
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>CSS selectors</h2>
    <div class="red">I am div styled using CLASS selector</div>
    <div id="yellow">I am a div styled using ID selector</div>
    <div>
      <p>
        I am a paragraph within a div. And i am direct child of div. So i can be
        styled using CHILD selector as 'div > p'
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <article>
        <p>
          I am a paragraph within a article tag that is nested under div. And i
          am NOT direct child of div. So i CANNOT be styled using CHILD selector
          as 'div > p'.
        </p>
      </article>
    </div>

    <div>
      <article>
        <span
          >I am a paragraph within a article tag that is nested under div. And i
          am NOT direct child of div. So i CAN be styled using DESCENDANT
          selector as 'div p'.</span
        >
      </article>
    </div>

    <h3>Now another category of selectors - pseudo selectors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>a:hover - to style the hover state</li>
      <li>a:visited - to style the visited link</li>
      <li>a:active - to style the active link</li>
      <li>a:link - to style the link</li>
      <li>p:link - to style the p tag wherever it is the first child of any parent tag</li>
    </ul>

    <main>
      <div>
        I am first child div of main tag
      </div>
      <div>
        I am second child div of main tag
      </div>
    </main>
    <h2>CSS- Box Model</h2>
    <div class="box box1">I am box. With padding = 20 px which is applied within the element and margin = 30px which is applied outside of the element. The border is applied on the element which includes the padding but not the margin. So the shaded blue area has the div along with the padding until the border. After that, margin starts.</div>
    <div class="box box2">I am another box. Height of the box is 200px. But the total height covered by this div will be 200px + 2*margin + 2*border + 2*padding, similarly for width.
      But if we also add box-sizzing property as bprder box, then it will keep the total width excluding the margin as 200px.
    </div>
    <p>Here the concept of margin collapse is also working which states that if the margin of two elements are overlapping, then the largest of them would be applied only.</p>
